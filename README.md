# InTandem Algorithm ðŸššðŸ“¦

**InTandem** is a dynamic shipping route optimization algorithm that adjusts paths in real-time based on disruption severityâ€”such as traffic, weather, fuel costs, and customs delays. It builds upon Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and applies weighted penalties to affected routes, enabling smarter, adaptive logistics planning.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Traditional shipping systems pre-plan routes and rarely adapt once disruptions occur. This results in delays, higher costs, and inefficiencies. The InTandem algorithm bridges this gap by re-evaluating route weights based on real-time conditions to ensure optimal delivery paths.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Uses Dijkstra's algorithm as a base
- Incorporates weighted disruption scores per route (edge)
- Applies a **quadratic penalty** to base cost if a disruption score exceeds a threshold
- Chooses paths that minimize total adjusted cost

### Pseudocode

```cpp
for each edge from current node:
    adjusted = baseWeight
    if disruption score > threshold:
        adjusted = baseWeight * (1 + (score - threshold)^2)
    if current_cost + adjusted < dist[to]:
        update dist[to]
```

## ðŸ§ª Runtime & Memory

- **Time Complexity:** `O((V + E) log V)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(V + E)`
  > Uses a priority queue (min-heap) and adjacency list for efficiency.

Tested on graphs of up to 50+ nodes for scalability evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Add API hooks for real-time disruption feeds
- Expand to multiple simultaneous shipments
- Include time window constraints and urgency levels
- Integrate with map or logistics data systems
- Handle different route optimization goals: shortest, fastest, safest, or cheapest
