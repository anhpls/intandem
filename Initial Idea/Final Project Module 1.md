#### **Adaptive Shipment Reallocation Algorithm for Real-Time Logistics Disruptions Problem: **

Shipments can get delayed by bad weather, port backups, customs issues, or other unexpected problems. Most current routing algorithms pick the best route at the start, but once the shipment is on the way, they can’t really adapt if something changes. My idea is to build an adaptive algorithm that keeps watching for disruptions in real-time and updates shipping routes on the fly, so delays or extra costs can be avoided as much as possible.

**Core Insight:**

The algorithm combines Dijkstra’s shortest path with real-time priority updates. As new events come in (like delays or issues), it keeps re-checking and adjusting the best routes. Each part of the route gets new weights based on things like updated costs, delays, or risks.

Higher weight = less desirable.

longer delay → higher weight; higher cost → higher weight; higher risk → higher weight.


At certain points during the shipment, it checks if it still makes sense to stay on the current route or switch to a better option. These “reallocation windows” let it reroute shipments mid-transit if something better opens up.


**Novelty:**

Traditional route optimization assumes static inputs at dispatch. This algorithm builds on event-driven re-weighting combined with real-time data to introduce adaptive reallocation opportunities after shipment has already left origin.

Baseline O(E log V) for routing (Dijkstra)

E = number of edges (connections between nodes)

V = number of nodes (locations / hubs in your shipping network)

Additional O(log N) for each event-driven queue update.

**Validation Plan:**

Simulate shipping network with random disruptions. Compare traditional static routing vs adaptive model: measure total shipment time reduction, and number of successful reallocations.



The algorithm’s aggressiveness evolves as conditions worsen.
